Abstract: Web user agents include both web browsers and other intermediaries
    between end-users and the web.
    Each user agent serves its user,
    not any of the other constituencies.
    A user agent owes its user various duties,
    which should be established through collective discussions
    and embodied in the various standards that user agents implement.

# Audience # {#audience}

This document is intended for:

* **Technical authors** who want to reuse or reference these concepts in their own specifications or documentation.
* **User agent developers** who want to align implementations with design and privacy principles that prioritize their users.
* **Web developers** who want to understand why user agents prioritize user privacy and security over other constituencies, including developer convenience.
* **Regulators and policymakers** who seek to understand the duties, principles, and expectations guiding user agent behavior.

# What is a web user agent # {#what}

A <dfn lt="user agent|web user agent" export>web user agent</dfn> is
any software entity that interacts with websites outside the entity itself,
on behalf of its user,
including simply rendering the content of websites.
In web specifications and the rest of this document,
web user agents are usually referred to as just "[=user agents=]",
but there are other kinds of user agents in other domains,
for example "mail user agents" in the context of email.
A person can use many different user agents in their day-to-day life.

The most common type of web user agent is the web browser,
including in-app browsers that can follow cross-site links.
However, user agents also include other tools like
search engines, voice-driven assistants, and generative AI systems
that present snippets or summaries of website content,
or help people navigate and interact with websites.

User agent behavior is not completely defined by web standards
or even by technical specifications in general.
In particular,
user agents choose which specifications to implement in order to best serve their users,
and they implement proprietary user interfaces and other behavior
around the specifications they do implement.


# Duties of user agents # {#duties}

Each user agent serves its user ([[!RFC8890 inline]]),
not any of the other constituencies.
A user agent owes its user various duties,
which should be established through collective discussions
and embodied in the various standards that user agents implement.


## Protection ## {#protection}

[[design-principles#safe-to-browse|It should be safe to visit a web page.]]
Visiting a page must not by itself
let the page change the user's computer or environment,
such as by installing software or accessing hardware.

Any data revealed to sites or other observers
should be aligned with the user's preferences
and follow the principle of [[design-principles#data-minimization|data minimization]].
In particular, user agents must act to
limit the potential for sites to track user activity [[unsanctioned-tracking]].

Users may [choose to share more information](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/#dfn-opt-in),
such as by filling out forms or granting permissions.
Even then, user agents must help users avoid deception and
clearly signal when a page attempts to gain elevated access.

Access to local files or other sensitive resources
must be limited to clear, intentional user actions, with appropriate warnings.

<div class="example" id="example-protection-exploits" heading="Attacks">

User agents need to prevent malicious code on a site from
being able to escape the user agent
to modify the user’s computer or access other [=origins=].
User agents meet this duty of protection by sandboxing components,
using memory-safe languages,
and employing security teams to find and respond to vulnerabilities.
These defenses need to evolve continuously to address new threats.

</div>

<div class="example" id="example-protection-tracking" heading="Tracking">

If a person visits unrelated websites,
it's feasible to avoid sending a shared identifying cookie to embedded iframes.
A browser that does send such a cookie is failing its duty of protection.
However, revealing a stable IP address is currently unavoidable,
so it's not a violation.

</div>

<div class="example" id="example-protection-local-files" heading="Local Files">

User agents are expected to prevent pages from accessing local files
unless the user explicitly selects or opens one.
This motivates behaviors like:

* giving each `file:` URL its own [=url/origin=],
* removing path components from
    <a element-state for="input" lt="File Upload">`<input type=file>`</a> uploads, and
* restricting which local fonts can be used in <a at-rule>@font-face</a> rules.

However, users can still choose to share files,
e.g., via uploads or downloads.
APIs like [[file-system-access inline]] don’t violate this duty,
provided users can [[design-principles#consent|meaningfully consent]].

</div>


## Honesty ## {#honesty}

A user agent is responsible to explain to its user what's going on,
in terms that user is likely to be able to understand.
These explanations should happen at appropriate times and frequencies,
so that they actually help the user understand
instead of interrupting and distracting the user.


## Loyalty ## {#loyalty}

A user agent must serve its user's interests
over its implementer's interests
and over the interests of any other party.

A user agent can be loyal
while also collecting payment for its services,
as long as that payment is fair and was agreed ahead of time.

A user agent can also help its user
make a credible commitment to a page in order to get that page's services,
and it's not disloyal to maintain that commitment after getting the services.
