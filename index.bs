Abstract: Web user agents include both web browsers and other intermediaries
    between end-users and the web.
    Each user agent serves its user,
    not any of the other constituencies.
    A user agent owes its user various duties,
    which should be established through collective discussions
    and embodied in the various standards that user agents implement.

# What is a web user agent # {#what}

A <dfn lt="user agent|web user agent" export>web user agent</dfn> is
any software entity that interacts with websites outside the entity itself,
on behalf of its user,
including just to display the content of websites.
In web specifications and the rest of this document,
web user agents are usually referred to as just "[=user agents=]",
but there are other kinds of user agents in other domains,
for example "mail user agents" in the context of email.
A person can use many different user agents in their day-to-day life.

The most common type of web user agent is the web browser,
including in-app browsers that can follow cross-site links.
However, search engines, voice-driven assistants, and generative AI systems
that can present snippets or summaries of websites to their users,
or help their users interact with websites,
can also be user agents.

User agent behavior is not completely defined by web standards
or even by technical specifications in general.
In particular,
user agents choose which specifications to implement in order to best serve their users,
and they implement proprietary user interfaces and other behavior
around the specifications they do implement.


# How the ecosystem works # {#ecosystem}

The structure of the web browser market helps ensure that browsers act as trustworthy agents,
but it can also give them conflicts of interest.
There are many browsers available for free,
which allows users to switch away from a browser that violates their trust.
Security and privacy researchers also actively investigate browser behavior
and publicize any unexpected or user-hostile behavior,
which helps users pick a browser and be confident that it's trustworthy.
These researchers benefit from the parts of browsers that are open source.

The trustworthiness of the available browsers is further aided
by a culture of service to end-users among the people who develop browsers.
However, we can't just assume that culture will sustain itself:
it's important that browsers which lose that culture also lose in the marketplace,
fast enough to prevent the culture-loss from spreading.


# Duties of user agents # {#duties}

Each user agent serves its user ([[!RFC8890 inline]]),
not any of the other constituencies.
A user agent owes its user various duties,
which should be established through collective discussions
and embodied in the various standards that user agents implement.


## Protection ## {#protection}

[[design-principles#safe-to-browse|It should be safe to visit a web page.]]
That is, simply visiting a page must not allow
the page to make permanent changes to the user's computer or environment
(for example by installing malware),
and simply visiting should reveal
as little information as practical about the user to the page,
to the user's environment,
and to any other interested actor.

Users can opt into sharing more information with a page they visit,
for example by entering or auto-filling data into form fields,
or granting permissions to the page.
Users can also allow the page to make changes to their environment,
for example by installing native programs that the page offers.
Even in these cases,
user agents should strive to prevent pages from tricking their users
and should help their users notice
when they might be giving the page more power than they intended.


## Honesty ## {#honesty}

A user agent is responsible to explain to its user what's going on,
in terms that user is likely to be able to understand.
These explanations should happen at appropriate times and frequencies,
so that they actually help the user understand
instead of interrupting and distracting the user.


## Loyalty ## {#loyalty}

A user agent must serve its user's interests
over its implementer's interests
and over the interests of any other party.

A user agent can be loyal
while also collecting payment for its services,
as long as that payment is fair and was agreed ahead of time.

A user agent can also help its user
make a credible commitment to a page in order to get that page's services,
and it's not disloyal to maintain that commitment after getting the services.
